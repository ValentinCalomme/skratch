    "My name is Valentin and I originally come from Belgium. I lived in the United States for a bit and then I went on to study data science at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. I now work as a data scientist at a company called Mediaan, which means that I am able to fully embrace my passion for machine learning on a daily basis.\n",

    "I am also passionate about teaching and really believe that you cannot master a topic until you are able to explain it to others. This is one of the main reasons I decided to start this website. On one hand, I wanted to spread good resources about machine learning, and on the other, I wanted to further my education on the topic.\n",
