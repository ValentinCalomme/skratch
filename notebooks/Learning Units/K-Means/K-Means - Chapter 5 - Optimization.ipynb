    "# Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "There are certain ways that K-Means can be optimized. One is to ensure that the local minimum that is found as is close to the global minimum, and the other is to find the optimal number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing K\n",
    "\n",
    "In some applications, K might be known in advance, and therefore, this section can be skipped. But in many applications, it is not quite clear what number of K is best. If we think about it, we see that increasing K will almost always reduce the inertia. Why? Because if there are more centroids, then each point is likely to be closer to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can't simply loop through values of K and see which one has the lowest inertia, as this would almost always yield a value close to the number of data points, which is not quite helpful. One technique to solve this is called the Elbow method. In short, the [Elbow method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_method_%28clustering%29) tries out more and more clusters, until the inertia's decrease starts to slowÂ down.\n",

    "## Multiple runs\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the outcome of K-Means is dependent on the initial centroids, it is common to run the algorithm multiple times. Code-wise, it simply means adding a loop around the `fit` method. For interface reasons, the method will be renamed `_fit`."

    "\n",
    "Running the algorithm multiple times will automatically increase the chances of finding a good local optimum. On top of this, people have come up with different ways to initialize the centroids which increase both the speed and the quality of the local optimum that is found.\n",
