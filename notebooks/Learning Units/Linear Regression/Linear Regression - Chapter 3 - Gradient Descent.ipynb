    "As it was mentioned in the previous chapter, whilst Linear Regression can be sometimes solved analytically, it doesnâ€™t always work in practice. Gradient descent is an iterative optimizer which works quite well in practice. The core principle is that it uses the gradient of the loss function in order to know in which direction the weights should go.\n",

    "In this case, the loss is identical to the Mean-Squared Error, and therefore, it represents how close the predictions that the model makes are to the correct values, penalizing large errors proportionally more. Being able to calculate the loss and its gradient means that we can know in which direction we should update our weights in order to reduce the loss, which is the ultimate goal.\n",
