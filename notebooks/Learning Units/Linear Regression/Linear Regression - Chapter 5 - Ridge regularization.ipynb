    "\n",
    "Ridge regularization is an alternative to LASSO. It minimizes the L2-Norm instead of the L1-Norm, which means that the weights are maintained under control but not necessarily to zero. This offers a smoother alternative to LASSO, as the modelled function might still need to be high-dimensional in certain areas.\n",
