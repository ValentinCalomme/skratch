    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is a technique used for classification that has been studied since the 1950s. It was first used for text categorization, predicting whether a text is of one type or another, spam or not spam, English or German, for instance. It is still used to this day as a benchmark for this class of tasks. Of course, it can be used for any classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers are generative models. This means that they will try to learn how instances of a certain class are generated by looking at what they inherently have in common. Let’s illustrate this with an example. Let’s say that we are given a dataset containing information about weight, height, and sex of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "By looking at this data, we could infer that males seem to be taller and heavier than females. Therefore, if we had to generate new male data points, we would be more likely to generate people measuring 1m80 and weighing 85kg rather than people measuring 1m60 and weighing 60kg.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if we encounter a person measuring 1m92 and weighing 102kg, we would classify them as males because we would be more likely to generate such a person as a male rather than a female.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bayes’ Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent this concept mathematically, we make use of Bayes’ Theorem. Which is represented by the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(\\text{Class} \\mid \\text{Features}) = \\frac{P(\\text{Class}) P(\\text{Features} \\mid \\text{Class})}{P(\\text{Features})}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The theorem gives us a way to calculate the probability of a class (male or female) given some features (height and weight). Therefore, to make a prediction, we will need to calculate the probability for both classes and pick the class with the highest one.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are trying to classify a person measuring 1m80 and weighting 80kg, Bayes’ Formula takes the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(\\text{Gender} \\mid \\text{Height}=180, \\text{Weight} = 60) = \\frac{P(\\text{Gender}) \\space P(\\text{Height}=180, \\text{Weight} = 60 \\mid \\text{Gender})}{P(\\text{Height}=180, \\text{Weight} = 60)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which can be read in statistical term as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Posterior} = \\frac{\\text{Prior} \\times \\text{Likelihood}}{\\text{Evidence}}$"
