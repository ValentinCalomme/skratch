    "# Evaluating Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is all about getting better and better at a task. Therefore, we need to define what it means to be good. In the case of classification, it is better to predict as many target variables accurately as possible. But how do we represent that? There exist several performance metrics to evaluate regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy is a straight-forward method which tells us how many classes were correctly predicted overall. It gives a clear idea of how well a model is performing when classes are balanced. Indeed, if classes aren’t balanced, let’s say 95% class 1 and 5% class 2, we could always predict class 1 and already have an accuracy of 95%. But we might not want to never predict class 2."

    "A good model should have a high recall and a high precision. In some cases, one matters more than the other. The $F_\\beta$ measure is defined as the weighted harmonic mean of the recall and the precision and therefore provides a single metric combining the two. The $\\beta$ parameter influences the weight given to the precision. If it is set to $1$, precision and recall are weighted equally. If it is less than $1$, recall is favoured. If it is more than $1$, precision is favoured. Typically, $\\beta$ is set to $1$ and the measure is then called the $F_1$ score."
