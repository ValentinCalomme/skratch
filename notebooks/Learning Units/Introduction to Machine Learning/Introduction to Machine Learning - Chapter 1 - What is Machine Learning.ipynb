    "# What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "The term “Machine Learning” is often considered to have been coined by Arthur Samuel in 1959. Samuel was a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence and is famous for having written a checkers-playing program, one of the first self-learning programs in the world. He came up with the following definition for Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "**“Machine Learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.”** \n",
    "\n",
    "The most important part of the definition is what he calls “being explicitly programmed”. Indeed, one could say that machine learning is _implicit programming_ whereas traditional computer science is _explicit programming_. Let’s say that we would like to build a spam detection system for an e-mail client. The goal of such a system would be to correctly identify spam whilst never filtering out e-mails that are not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume that our input is an e-mail object containing information about the content of the e-mail, the sender, the time it was sent etc."

    "Implicitly programming a computer to detect spam e-mails is not completely different from explicitly programming it. We would also need to write a program that is able to filter spams given a set of rules. The real difference comes with how the rules are created. In the previous example, we had to explicitly write out what the rules were. We had to create the list of blocked senders and define that “this is a spam” is a string that is indicative of spam e-mails. In machine learning, we let the program learn these rules on its own.\n",
