    "In machine learning, there are typically generative and discriminative classification models. The main difference lies in what these models are learning. Discrimative models learn what makes instances of different classes different, most of the time by learning decision boundaries. Whereas generative models learn what makes instances of a same class unique, most of the time by learning how to generate similar instances."
