# Skratch

## Current modules on website

- [K-Means](https://skratch.valentincalomme.com/learning-units/unsupervised/k-means/)
- [K-NN](https://skratch.valentincalomme.com/learning-units/supervised/k-nearest-neighbours/)

## Implemented in the source code

- KNN classification
- KNN regression
- K-Means clustering
- K-Medians clustering
- K-Medoids clustering
- Common distance measures

## Tested against scikit-learn

In order to ensure that the implementations are correct, tests are run to check the output of the various models and compare them to the output of scikit-learn's.

The tests are written using pytest.
